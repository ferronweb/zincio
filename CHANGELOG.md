# `zincio` change log

## `zincio` UNRELEASED

**Not yet released**

- Renamed the project from `vibeio` to `zincio`.

## `vibeio` 0.2.21

**Released in August 21, 2026**

- Added Linux-specific `uring()` method to runtime builder.
- Added `spawn_detached` fast path for spawning tasks without join handles.
- Fixed some panics when runtime is shut down due to an internal runtime being already borrowed.
- Fixed some issues with `io_uring` wakers by using separate wakers for read and write interests.
- Improved `io_uring` performance (including bumping SQ size to 4096).
- Optimized executor and task management in multiple places.
- Optimized timer performance by skipping wheel and halving clock reads when idle.

## `vibeio` 0.2.20

**Released in August 16, 2026**

- Improved error reporting for some internal `vibeio` panics.
- `IoVectoredBuf` now requires `as_iovecs` to be implemented for the buffer type (similar with `IoVectoredBufMut` with `as_iovecs_mut`).

## `vibeio` 0.2.19

**Released in July 26, 2026**

- Added platform-specific (Apple, Linux, Unix, Windows) getters for file metadata.

## `vibeio` 0.2.18

**Released in July 24, 2026**

- Added support for `sendfile_exact()` on FreeBSD.
- `sendfile_exact()` now uses `sendfile` syscall directly when using poll-based I/O on Linux.

## `vibeio` 0.2.17

**Released in July 23, 2026**

- Fixed compilation errors when building for GNU/Hurd targets (caused by missing `sin_len` and `sin6_len` struct fields in `sockaddr_in` and `sockaddr_in6` respectively).
- Fixed event loop stalls when `poll` is used with `mio` (not `epoll`).

## `vibeio` 0.2.16

**Released in July 21, 2026**

- Fixed musl v1.2.x detection based on environment variables for updated `libc` crate versions.
- Optimized `CompletionBuffer` to avoid unnecessary boxed allocations when not needed.
- The event loop now flushes the I/O driver (like `io_uring` SQ or I/O completion ports) less frequently (when the batch size exceeds 64 tasks).

## `vibeio` 0.2.15

**Released in July 6, 2026**

- Fixed high latency caused by incorrect io_uring driver optimization

## `vibeio` 0.2.14

**Released in July 4, 2026**

- Added `AsyncReadPoll` and `AsyncWritePoll` traits for poll-based async read/write readiness interfaces.
- Added `PollUdpSocket` struct for poll-based UDP socket readiness interfaces.
- Added `time` Cargo feature to `vibeio-hyper` that can be optionally disabled.
- Added `try_io_readable` and `try_io_writable` methods to `PollUdpSocket`, `PollTcpStream`, and `PollUnixStream`.
- Applied some Linux-specific optimizations (`accept4`, `pipe2` system calls).
- Initial version of `vibeio-quinn` crate for poll-based QUIC socket readiness interfaces.
- `vibeio-hyper` now no longer depends on all the Cargo features of `vibeio`.

## `vibeio` 0.2.13

**Released in June 12, 2026**

- Added `TcpListener::from_std_poll` method for Windows.
- Fixed accepting TCP sockets for 32-bit Windows failing out with "unsupported socket family" error ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/ferronweb/ferron/issues/662))

## `vibeio` 0.2.12

**Released in May 27, 2026**

- Fixed a crash when mio (epoll, kqueue, poll) operation was interrupted.
- Performed several timer and executor optimizations

## `vibeio` 0.2.11

**Released in May 17, 2026**

- Fixed file descriptors not being freed when `io_uring` is used and there are pending operations on Linux 5.19+
